Located on the southern shore of Zlato, the small town of Dalibor is an important harbour for trade between The Crown and Havestrall, as well as a waypoint for those travelling from The Western Wilds. There are only a few hundred residents of the town, split between permanent citizens and those simply there for work. It is held under the protection of [[For The Players/The Locations/Lumina|Lumina]] and has not needed protection for some time, though there has been a recent increase in raiding parties boarding ships bound for the harbour. Though light on traditional exports, Dalibor does have one shining export: hops. Dalibor beer is known as some of the finest in Havestrall, and traders passing through are often expected to bring back a few kegs on their travels.
