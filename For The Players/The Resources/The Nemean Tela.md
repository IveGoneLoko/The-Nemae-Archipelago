The **Nemean Tela** is the primary currency of the Nemean Archipelago. Though there are several different region-specific currencies, the Tela is the only currency acceptable for exchange between the Major Isles.
A Tela is a 10-sided silver coin. It is engineered with ten sections formed in a ring; this ring can then be split in half to create a **Cape**, or shattered entirely to give ten small **Bits**. The Bits and Tela are equivalent to the Copper and Silver coins (respectively) of Fiántas, but do not require minting an additional coin. Ten Bits can be housed in a Sleeve to recreate a Tela, and ten Tela can be strung together to form a makeshift **Aurum** (the equivalent of the Gold coin of Fiántas). Real Aurums are quite uncommon and often used ostentatiously rather than practically.  **Scales** (the equivalent of the Platinum coin of Fiántas) are incredibly rare and only used in secure transports move large sums of money.
